hi guys,
this is my hackintosh setup:
- A520M-K v2
- RYZEN 5 4500 6C 12T
- RX 6600
- 16 GB RAM DDR4 3200

What works:
CPU- 100%
NVME- 100%
MOTHERBOARD- 100%
USB- 100%
GPU WITH ACCELERATION- 100%
NETWORK- 100%
AUDIO- 100%

What may work:
POWERMANAGEMENT- 99% best that AMDRyzenCPUPowerManagement can do
iServices= yes and no- can login into icloud and appstore,but iMessage does not work

What does not work:
Everything seems to work fine, but sometimes it just lags/freezes for a second or two.
